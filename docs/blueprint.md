- The primary color should be a vibrant sky blue (#72B6FF), evoking feelings of friendship and transparency.
- Use a very light desaturated blue background (#F0F8FF). This will complement the primary color and offer a clean look.
- Select an analogous accent color like a muted periwinkle (#B0A4E3) to bring a touch of sophistication without distracting from the core functionality.
- A clear and readable sans-serif font for all text.
- Simple, outlined icons for actions and navigation.
